        description: `Fire generates significant losses across the world, which can be mitigated by adopting proper steps aided by systems 
        backed by geo-information technology. As a result, the Firetrack team developed this web application to use maps to track fire 
        hydrants and alarms. The City of Cebu was chosen as the application's pilot area for the system's implementation. It was also 
        the basis for sample geographical data in support of fire management. The map-based technology 
        could quantify the quantity and geographic distribution of firewater hydrants. It will be able to look up the location of a fire 
         hydrant and its current status, such as whether it is operational, operating at a regular pressure, or detached from the water 
         supply. It will also give the general public the location of the fire and a News API that shows recent events and current affairs. 
         The application intends to increase the Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP) and other connected organizations' fire safety management 
         efficiency, as well as the community's overall fire prevention and control capabilities.`,
