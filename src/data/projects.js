        title: 'FIRETRACK WEB APP',
        description: `The Firetrack team developed this web application to use maps to track fire hydrants and alarms. It is capable of
        displaying a geographic distribution of firewater hydrants. It will be able to look up the location of a fire hydrant 
        and its current status, such as whether it is operational, operating at a regular pressure, or detached from the water supply. It also 
        gives the general public the location of the fire and a News API that shows recent events and current affairs.`,
